## why ?

I want to learn more about low level coding and pratices. So I decided to go back to C lang ( I glimpsed far ago).
I just don't want to study Cmake and want to have an equivalent to nodemon / npm run dev.

I will post in this repo my fails and my success. 

I'm beggining with bash/inotify but I will certainly change for other tech.
My only constraint is to make it usable on any platform

As I want to be a Rust dev I will cerntainly try do refactor it in this language ;)


## commands

run ./run.sh


> not working currently need to investigate on inotify wait
